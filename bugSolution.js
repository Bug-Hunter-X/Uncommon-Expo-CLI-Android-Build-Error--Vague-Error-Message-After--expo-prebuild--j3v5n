// bugSolution.js
// This file outlines the troubleshooting steps to resolve the vague Expo prebuild error.

// 1. Verify Android Setup:
// Ensure that Android Studio is correctly installed and configured.  Check the SDK and build tools versions. 
// Follow the official Expo documentation for Android setup instructions.

// 2. Clean and Rebuild the Project:
// Try cleaning the project using `expo prebuild --clean` before running `expo prebuild` again. 

// 3. Check Dependencies:
// Review your package.json file for any conflicting or outdated dependencies that might interfere with the build process.  Update packages as necessary and run `expo prebuild` again.

// 4. Check the Expo SDK version:
// Make sure your Expo SDK version is compatible with your project and the Android environment. Check the Expo documentation for version compatibility information.

// 5. Check for Missing Files or Incorrect Configurations:
// Carefully review your project's Android configuration files (e.g., `android/app/build.gradle`). Ensure that all necessary files and configurations are correctly specified.

// 6. Review the Expo CLI logs carefully:
// Although the main error message might be vague, look closely at the entire log output. There might be more detailed warnings or errors buried within the log that provide clues.

// 7. Create a Minimal Reproducible Example:
// To facilitate troubleshooting, create a minimal project that reproduces the error. This helps to isolate the problem and rule out unrelated factors.

// 8. Check for Antivirus interference:
// Occasionally, antivirus software may interfere with the build process. Temporarily disable your antivirus to rule out this possibility.
